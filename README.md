This is the latest source release.
I usually update it only after major updates.

If there are too many minor updates or small fixes in a short time, I might skip uploading new source versions until everything settles down.
That way, you always get a clean, stable build, not a flood of small changes.

Thanks for understanding and supporting the project!
